# Makefile Utility
- `make` and `make libft` will compile the Libft Project, as the library `libft.a`.
- `make clean` will delete all the compile `.o` files.
- `make fclean` will run `make clean` and then delete the library `libft.a`
- `make re` will run the comands, `make fclean` then `make`, to delete (if possible) `libft.a` and all `.o` files, then compile the library `libft.a`
